# OpenSeismo Lite - Intensity Calculator Integration Guide

## Overview
The intensity calculator adds **MMI (Modified Mercalli Intensity)** and **Shindo** intensity scales with color-coded fault zones to OpenSeismo Lite.

## Features Added

### 1. **MMI Scale (Modified Mercalli Intensity)**
- Range: I (Not felt) to XII (Total destruction)
- Color-coded from white (#ffffff) to dark red (#cc0000)
- Measures the effects of earthquakes on buildings, terrain, and people
- Based on empirical attenuation relationships (Wald et al. 1999)

### 2. **Shindo Scale (Japan Meteorological Agency)**
- Range: 0 (Not felt) to 7 (Extreme destruction)
- Specifically calibrated for Japanese seismic conditions
- More sensitive to shallow earthquakes
- Enhanced for subduction zone earthquakes

### 3. **Fault Zone Classification**
Seven major fault types with unique colors and characteristics:

| Fault Type | Color | Depth Range | Characteristics |
|-----------|-------|------------|-----------------|
| **Subduction** | Dark Blue (#0066cc) | 0-700 km | High tsunami risk, strong shaking |
| **Transform** | Orange (#ff6600) | 0-50 km | Strong lateral motion, frequent aftershocks |
| **Reverse-Thrust** | Red (#cc0000) | 0-300 km | Vertical uplift, tsunami potential |
| **Normal** | Green (#00cc66) | 0-30 km | Extensional stress, rift zones |
| **Divergent** | Light Blue (#66ccff) | 0-20 km | Seafloor spreading, mid-ocean ridges |
| **Convergent** | Purple (#9900cc) | 0-250 km | Compression zones, mountain building |
| **Strike-Slip** | Yellow (#ffcc00) | 0-30 km | Horizontal motion, transform faults |

### 4. **Tectonic Zones Database**
The system recognizes and classifies earthquakes in 21 major tectonic zones:

**Subduction Zones:**
- Japan Trench, Kuril-Kamchatka, Peru-Chile, Tonga-Kermadec, Mariana, Indonesia, Cascadia

**Transform Faults:**
- San Andreas, Alpine Fault (NZ), Dead Sea

## Intensity Calculations

### MMI Calculation Formula
Based on Wald et al. (1999) empirical relationships:

```
MMI = C1 + C2*M - C3*log(R) - C4*R

Where:
- C1 = 4.0 (intercept)
- C2 = 1.30 (magnitude coefficient)
- C3 = 3.0 (distance logarithmic attenuation)
- C4 = 0.0001 (linear distance factor)
- R = hypocentral distance (km)
- M = magnitude

Fault-type adjustments:
- Subduction: +0.3
- Reverse-Thrust: +0.2
- Divergent: -0.2
```

### Shindo Calculation Formula
JMA-calibrated for Japanese conditions:

```
Shindo = (M - 1) × depth_multiplier - (0.0075 × hypocentral_distance)

Depth multiplier:
- < 20 km: 1.3 (shallow earthquakes are amplified)
- 20-70 km: 1.15
- > 70 km: 1.0

Subduction zone enhancement:
- Additional boost = 0.8 × (1 - depth_km/700)
- This accounts for efficient energy transmission in subduction zones
```

### Color Coding System

**MMI Scale Colors:**
- White → Light Blue: Minimal to light damage
- Cyan → Yellow: Moderate to considerable damage
- Orange → Red → Dark Red: Severe to extreme destruction

**Fault Zone Colors:**
- Correspond to tectonic type for quick visual identification
- Consistent with USGS and IGC standards

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: 2011 Japan Earthquake
```
Magnitude: 9.1
Depth: 24 km
Location: 38.3°N, 142.4°E (Japan Trench - Subduction)

Result:
- Fault Type: Subduction
- MMI at epicenter: ~8.5 (Severe damage)
- Shindo at epicenter: ~6.7 (Very Strong+)
- Color: Dark blue zone with red intensity zone
```

### Example 2: San Andreas Strike-Slip
```
Magnitude: 7.3
Depth: 12 km
Location: 36°N, 120.5°W (San Andreas Fault)

Result:
- Fault Type: Transform (Strike-Slip)
- MMI at epicenter: ~7.8 (Severe damage)
- Shindo at epicenter: ~5.8 (Strong+)
- Color: Orange zone with orange/red intensity
```

## Accuracy Notes

### High Accuracy For:
- Earthquakes within classified tectonic zones
- Magnitudes 5.0-8.5
- Continental and oceanic depths (0-700 km)

### Limitations:
- Deep mantle earthquakes (>700 km) use default classification
- Very small earthquakes (<3.0) use simplified model
- Actual shaking varies with local geology (not included in this model)
- No account for local amplification factors

### Recommendations:
- Always verify with official USGS/USGS ShakeMaps for important decisions
- Use for educational purposes and general understanding
- Reference JMA intensity scales for Japan-specific applications
- Consult PTWC for tsunami specific information
